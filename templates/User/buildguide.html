                great for your first build. Other case manufacturers we like are NZXT, Fractal, Phanteks, Cooler Master,
                and Lian Li.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">2:- &nbsp; NZXT H710i ATX Mid-Tower: This is one of my faves.
                It has a slick aesthetic and slightly compact silhouette without compromising cooling capability or
                accessibility.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">3:- &nbsp; MSI Gungnir 100 ATX Mid-Tower Case: This
                budget-friendly case is a solid option for most people. Be aware that it'll be a tight fit—there's
                almost no wiggle room for bulky cables or hyperspecific configurations. It looks nicer than you'd think
                for the money, and the RGB button syncs up your lights with very little effort. The smokey tempered

            The internal layout of every gaming PC is a little different, so we're not going to get too far into the
            weeds here. Your best bet for specific instructions for your hardware will be referencing your manuals and
            searching for your components on YouTube. It can be super helpful to actually see a person handle and
            install your exact hardware, especially when you're stuck and can't quite figure out what the hell your
            manual is talking about. But here are some general tips for putting all these components together. First,
            prep yourself a clean workspace. This can be a dining room table, a cleared-off desk—just any surface big
            enough for your case to lay flat on its side, with ample room around it for the rest of your components.
            You’ll also need a Phillips-head screwdriver that will fit the screws on your case. When you put these parts
            together, be sure to discharge any static buildup and work on a nonmetallic surface like a wooden table. Or
            you could just assemble the motherboard on top of the cardboard box it comes in. Most of the components you
            bought are going to come with instruction manuals; keep them handy. We’re going to start with the
            motherboard, so open up the instruction manual to the installation page. It can be pretty
            intimidating—there’s a lot to look at—but think of all this as a big Lego set. Each piece fits into each
            other piece. For the motherboard, your first job is going to be seating your CPU.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="components-notice mt-5 ms-auto me-auto p-4">
        <p class="fs-3">Installing Your CPU:-</p>
        <p class="fs-6 text-justify">
            Depending on what kind of CPU you purchased (Intel or AMD), the chip will have either little prongs on one
            side (don’t touch them) or little golden contacts on one side (don’t touch them). Seriously, don’t touch
            that side of your chip. Oils from your fingertips can damage the contacts, or you might bend a pin. Do
            either one and your processor becomes nothing more than an expensive hunk of silicon.

            Seating your processor is pretty easy. First, double-check your motherboard’s instructions and make sure
            you’ve unlocked the processor socket. It’ll be a big square with a bunch of little holes (or contacts), with
            a lever or button beside it. Your motherboard’s instructions will say explicitly how to unlock the socket so
            you can put your processor in without any issues.

            Once you’ve confirmed that it’s unlocked and ready, just find which corner of your processor has a little
            golden triangle and line it up with the same symbol on your motherboard’s processor socket. Gently lower the
            processor into the socket, then gently flip the latch or locking mechanism. You shouldn’t have to fight it.
            If you have to press really hard, double-check that the processor is socketed correctly.

            Next, you’re going to need your thermal paste. That little tiny plastic syringe of silvery goo is very
            important for this next step. Now that your processor is seated, take a look at the shiny square of silicon
            in the center of it. That’s where your heat sink is going to sit. Your processor came with a heat sink, and
            on one side of it, you’ll see a copper circle. You’re going to be putting the heat sink directly on top of
            the processor after we apply the thermal paste, with the silicone square and the copper circle lining up
            perfectly.

            Go ahead and carefully squeeze a tiny ball (no bigger than a pea) of thermal paste onto the silicon square
            on your processor. You’ll want it as close to the center as you can get.

            Now line up your heat sink with the screws surrounding your processor, and gently lower it into place.
            You’re gonna squish the thermal paste, and the goal here is to create a thin layer covering the back of your
            processor. It’s OK if it oozes a little bit, but if it oozes out and over the edge of the processor, you
            used too much. Get some isopropyl alcohol, dab it on a lint-free wipe, and wipe the processor and heat sink.
            Wait till they’re thoroughly dry and try again.

            If it looks all right, screw your heat sink into place. Flip back to your motherboard instruction book and
            find the right place near the processor socket to plug in your heat sink’s cooling fan. It should be very
            close to your processor socket. Once you’ve found it, plug it in—congratulations, you just installed a CPU.
            This was the hardest part, and it’s over. Good job!

        <p class="fs-3">Installing Your Storage and Memory:-</p>
        <p class="fs-6 text-justify">
            Memory is maybe the easiest thing to install. See those vertical little sockets beside the CPU? Line up your sticks of RAM and slot them in, starting from the left-hand slot. They’ll lock into place once you’ve seated them properly. If you have two sticks of RAM, make sure to skip a slot between them. Your motherboard manual should say which slots to use. For your hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), find an empty bay in the front-facing part of your case. Slide your drive in and screw it into place. If you have an M.2 drive (a tiny SSD about the size of a stick of gum), there should be a place on the motherboard where you slot it in directly. Check out your motherboard’s manual to see where the M.2 slot is if you can't find it.

        <p class="fs-3">Installing Your Motherboard and Power Supply:-</p>
        <p class="fs-6 text-justify">
            The rest of this is formulaic. Start by putting your motherboard into your case. Consult your motherboard’s instructions, line up the screw holes in the case with the ones on your motherboard, and get to work. Next, you’ll want to install your power supply. There should be a spot for it near the top or bottom of the case, a big square spot that will fit your supply perfectly. If you’re having trouble finding it, look at the back of your case: There’ll be a big empty square. That’s where the power supply goes (and where you’ll plug in your PC when you’re all done). Once you've found its home, slot it in and screw it into place. Make sure all the snaky cables coming out of the power supply will reach your motherboard with room to spare. Don’t plug in anything yet; we’re going to come back to the power supply in a bit.

        <p class="fs-3">Installing Your Graphics Card:-</p>
        <p class="fs-6 text-justify">
            Your GPU is going to be pretty big. Even a modestly powerful GPU like the GTX 1060 is large compared to your other components. That means how it fits into your case is important. Once you put your GPU in there, space is going to start getting tight. Flip open your motherboard’s instruction book again and look for a PCIe slot. It’s going to be a horizontal slot with a little plastic latch beside it, near the middle or bottom of your motherboard. That’s where the GPU plugs in. All you need to do is identify the back of your GPU (the side with the HDMI and DisplayPorts), line that up with the back of your case, and push the GPU into the horizontal slot. It should lock into place easily enough; if it doesn’t, make sure you’re inserting it correctly. Find another one of those tiny little screws and fasten your GPU to the case. There’s a little spot for that on the same piece of metal with the HDMI ports. It should be easy to find.	Now, take a look at the cables coming out of your power supply. There should be a few that look like they could fit into the square (or rectangular) socket on the side of your GPU. It should look like six or eight little holes in a rectangle shape. If you’re having trouble, take a look at this video from hardware manufacturer Asus. Some of the specifics will be different, but it’s a great look at how to install a GPU.

        <p class="fs-3">Ribbon Cables:-</p>
        <p class="fs-6 text-justify">
            The motherboard needs to be hooked into all your devices. The power supply unit I used in this build is what's called fully modular, which means that you can select the cables you need and leave the rest off to eliminate clutter. Otherwise, power supplies have a ton of cables, and you'll have to deal with the unused power connections dangling inside your case. You'll need to connect the PSU to the SSD and the motherboard. You also need to plug the motherboard into your case—the power buttons, audio plugs, and USB ports on the front of your case. There are special headers for each kind of plug scattered around the board, so you'll want to check your manual for the location and function of each grouping of pins. These tiny pins need to be plugged in a certain way, and they're unbelievably minuscule. There's also a hookup for the case's fan—in the case I used there was one header on the motherboard but three fans installed. Then there's the SATA cable for your SSD, which plugs into the motherboard. This part of your build really depends on the hardware you purchased, so consult the manuals for each component to ensure you've correctly plugged it into your motherboard and the power supply.

            The final stage of your build is a simple one: Hit your power button. If the PC whirs to life, you probably put it together perfectly! If it doesn't, don't despair. There are a lot of potential problems that could cause a PC to fail to boot up for the first time. This video from Kingston goes over some pitfalls that might cause you some headaches, so if you're not able to boot your PC, give it a watch and retrace your steps. There's also a chance you could have received faulty components. This video goes over some tips on how to check your parts. In general, if you’re having trouble with a specific component, YouTube is your friend. There are tons of helpful PC-building tutorials If it started up just fine, the next step is super easy: Turn it off. Remember that Windows flash drive you made earlier? Plug it into the PC and boot it up again. If you set it up right, your computer should just do its thing and get started installing Windows. If not, you might need to open your BIOS (check your motherboard's manual for how to do that) and set the USB drive to be a “boot device” first. Here's a brief rundown of that process (start at step 3).
